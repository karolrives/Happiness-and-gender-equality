# Happiness-and-gender-equality
A data-based approach to find trends or patterns between happiness and gender equality for 2015-2017

## Installation

There is no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code runs with no issues using python 3  or newer versions.
You might need to update the link for the World Happiness datasets manually [https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness] (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) since I am importing the datasets through dynamic links.
