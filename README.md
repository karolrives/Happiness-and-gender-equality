# Happiness-and-gender-equality

A data-based approach to find trends or patterns between happiness and gender equality for 2015-2017

## Installation

There is no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code runs with no issues using python 3  or newer versions.
You might need to update the link for the World Happiness datasets manually [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) since I am importing the datasets through dynamic links.

## Project motivation

The main motivation was finding any pattern or trend that indicates a relationship between happiness and gender equlity

## File description

There is only one notebook here, which contains the full analysis of this project. The notebook is explanatory in searching through the data. Also Markdown cells were used to walk through all the steps.

## Results

The main findings of the code are presented in the post [here](https://medium.com/@karol.rives/women-the-source-of-all-evil-c246f0af2370)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for sharing the 2015-2017 World Happiness reports.
